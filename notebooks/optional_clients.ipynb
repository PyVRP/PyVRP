    "In this tutorial you have learned about modelling optional clients using PyVRP, and incentivising the solver to visit optional clients using the client's `prize` attribute.\n",
    "Optional clients are very helpful to ensure a feasible solution is always obtained, even when there are constraints that prevent PyVRP from servicing all clients.\n",
    "Furthermore, different prizes can be used to model different visit priorities: all else equal, PyVRP will prefer to schedule a higher-prize visit over one where it collects a lower prize. "
