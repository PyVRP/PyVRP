    "# Routing profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "PyVRP supports routing problems with multiple vehicle types.\n",
    "These vehicle types can differ in many ways, some of which we have already seen in previous tutorials.\n",
    "Another way in which vehicle types can differ is in the distances and durations of the paths they need to travel between locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explore PyVRP's *profiles*, which can be used to model these differences.\n",
    "The profile feature is particularly helpful for problems with mixed fleets of trucks, cars, and/or bicycles, as well as access restrictions."
