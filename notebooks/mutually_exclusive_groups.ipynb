    "Such alternatives often arise in applications where deliveries can be dropped off at different locations (for example, one of several delivery points in a large complex), or when there are multiple, disjunctive time windows (for example, morning or evening delivery).\n",
    "PyVRP's client groups provide a general way to model such situations.\n",
