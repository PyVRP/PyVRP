    "\n",
    "This quickstart notebook is intended as a first entrypoint to working with PyVRP.\n",
    "We will model and solve several vehicle routing problems, using PyVRP's high level `Model` interface.\n",
    "This interface makes it easy to define routing problems directly, using familiar routing terminology of clients, depots, vehicle types, and edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by modelling the routing problem of a small delivery company with a single depot and a few clients.\n",
    "As the business grows and constraints become more realistic, we adapt our model step-by-step.\n",
    "After the quickstart, you will be able to solve routing problems using PyVRP and are ready for the more focused tutorials presented elsewhere in our documentation."
