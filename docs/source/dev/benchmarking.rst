Benchmarking
============

To run a benchmark, one can use the command line interface PyVRP provides.
After installation, it is available as ``pyvrp`` from the command line.
To find out about available options, run

.. code-block:: shell

   pyvrp --help

We use the following instances and configurations to benchmark PyVRP:

* For the CVRP, we use `the X-instances of Uchoa <http://vrp.atd-lab.inf.puc-rio.br/media/com_vrp/instances/Vrp-Set-X.tgz>`_.
  Each instance has :math:`n` clients; the runtimes are computed as :math:`2.4 n` seconds on a reference CPU with PassMark score 2183.
  Thus, an instance with 100 clients is ran for 240 seconds, assuming a CPU with PassMark score 2183.
  For this benchmark, the ``round`` rounding function should be used.
  Additionally, the configuration specified in ``configs/cvrp.toml`` should be used.

* For the VRPTW, we use `the Gehring and Homberger instances <http://vrp.atd-lab.inf.puc-rio.br/media/com_vrp/instances/Vrp-Set-HG.tgz>`_, particularly those with 1000 clients.
  These instances are each run for two hours on a reference CPU with PassMark score 2000.
  For this benchmark, the ``dimacs`` rounding function should be used.
  Additionally, the configuration specified in ``configs/vrptw.toml`` should be used.

* For the PCVRPTW, we use `the modified Gehring and Homberger instances <https://github.com/PyVRP/Instances/tree/main/PCVRPTW#pcvrptw>`_ with 1000 clients.
  These instances are each run for two hours on a reference CPU with PassMark score 2000.
  For this benchmark, the ``dimacs`` rounding function should be used.
  Additionally, the configuration specified in ``configs/vrptw.toml`` should be used.

* For the MDVRPTW, we use `the large MDVRPTW instances of Vidal et al. (2013) <https://github.com/PyVRP/Instances/tree/main/MDVRPTW#mdvrptw>`_.
  These instances range in size from 360 to 960 clients.
  The instances are run with a stopping criterion of 2500 iterations without improvement, or five hours of runtime, whichever occurs first, on a reference CPU with PassMark score 1186.
  For this benchmark, the ``exact`` rounding function should be used.
  Additionally, the configuration specified in ``configs/vrptw.toml`` should be used.

* For the VRPB, we use `the 90 largest VRPB instances of Queiroga et al. (2020) <https://github.com/PyVRP/Instances/tree/main/VRPB#vrpb>`_.
  These instances range in size from 523 to 1000 clients.
  Each instance has :math:`n` clients; the runtimes are computed as :math:`2.4 n` seconds on a reference CPU with PassMark score 2000.
  Thus, an instance with 100 clients is ran for 240 seconds, assuming a CPU with PassMark score 2000.
  For this benchmark, the ``round`` rounding function should be used.
  Additionally, the configuration specified in ``configs/cvrp.toml`` should be used.

* For the HFVRP, we use `the HFVRP instances of Pessoa et al. (2018) <https://github.com/PyVRP/Instances/tree/main/HFVRP#hfvrp>`_.
  These instances range in size from 100 to 1000 clients, and are based on the X instances for CVRP.
  Each instance has :math:`n` clients; the runtimes are computed as :math:`2.4 n` seconds on a reference CPU with PassMark score 2000.
  Thus, an instance with 100 clients is ran for 240 seconds, assuming a CPU with PassMark score 2000.
  For this benchmark, the ``exact`` rounding function should be used.
  Additionally, the configuration specified in ``configs/cvrp.toml`` should be used.

* For the MTVRPTWR, we use `the instances of Yang (2023) and Yang (2024) <https://github.com/PyVRP/Instances/tree/main/MTVRPTWR#mtvrptwr>`_.
  These instances range in size from 100 to 200 clients and are based on the Solomon and Gehring & Homberger VRPTW instances.
  The instances are each run for ten minutes on a reference CPU with PassMark score 2000.
  For this benchmark, the ``dimacs`` rounding function should be used.
  Additionally, the configuration specified in ``configs/vrptw.toml`` should be used.

The time limit should be scaled by the PassMark score of your CPU.
Each instance is run ten times with different seeds.
Each run is performed on a single core.
For each instance, we take the average objectives of these ten runs with different seeds.
These are compared with the best-known solutions tracked in the ``PyVRP/Instances`` `repository <https://github.com/PyVRP/Instances>`_ to compute gaps.

To get the benchmark instance sets quickly, the ``PyVRP/Instances`` repository may be initialised as a submodule:

.. code-block:: shell

   git submodule init instances

After running this command, the instances will be available in ``instances/``.
