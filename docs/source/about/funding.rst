We are committed to developing high-quality, performant software for solving complex vehicle routing problems.
The value of such software is clear: PyVRP is used all over the world by many companies, in many different logistics settings.
However, maintaining and expanding the software is nontrivial and expensive, and we could use your help to ensure the project remains in a healthy state.
