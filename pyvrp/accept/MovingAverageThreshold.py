class MovingAverageThreshold:
    """
    The Moving Average Threshold (MAT) criterion of [1]. This criterion accepts
    a candidate solution if it is better than a threshold value that is based
    on the moving average of the objective values of recently observed
    candidate solutions. The threshold is computed as:

    .. math::

       f(s^*) + \\tilde{\\eta} \\times \\left(
          \\sum_{j = 1}^\\gamma \\frac{f(s^j)}{\\gamma} - f(s^*)
       \\right)

    where :math:`s^*` is the best solution observed in the last :math:`\\gamma`
    iterations, :math:`f(\\cdot)` indicates the objective function,
    :math:`\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{N}` is a parameter, and each :math:`s^j` is a
    recently observed solution. The recently observed solutions are stored in
    a ``history`` attributed of size at most :math:`\\gamma`.

    The algorithm incorporates a decreasing :math:`\\tilde{\\eta}` factor that
    converges to zero as the search approaches its maximum time limit or
    iterations. It is calculated as:

    .. math::
        \\tilde{\\eta} = \\eta \\times \\min\\left( 1 - \\frac{t}{T},
            1 - \\frac{i}{I} \\right)

    where :math:`\\eta \\ge 0` is a parameter, :math:`t` is the time elapsed
    since the start of the algorithm, :math:`T` is the imposed maximum runtime,
    :math:`i` is the number of iterations performed, and :math:`I` is the
    maximum number of iterations allowed. The most restrictive limit between
    the two is used to compute the factor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    eta
        Used to determine the threshold value. Larger values of :math:`\\eta`
        result in more accepted candidate solutions. Must be non-negative.
    gamma
        History size. Must be positive.
    max_runtime
        Maximum runtime in seconds. As the search approaches this time limit,
        :math:`\\eta` converges to zero. Must be non-negative. Default is
        ``float("inf")``, meaning that :math:`\\eta` stays constant.
    max_iterations
        Maximum number of iterations. As the search approaches this limit,
        :math:`\\eta` converges to zero. Must be non-negative. Default is
        ``float("inf")``, meaning that :math:`\\eta` stays constant.
