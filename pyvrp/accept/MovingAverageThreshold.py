class MovingAverageThreshold:
    R"""
    The Moving Average Threshold (MAT) criterion of [1]_. This criterion
    accepts a candidate solution if it is better than a threshold value that is
    based on the moving average of the objective values of recently observed
    candidate solutions. The threshold is computed as:

    .. math::

       f(s^*) + w \times \left(\sum_{j = 1}^N \frac{f(s^j)}{N} - f(s^*) \right)

    where :math:`s^*` is the best solution observed in the last :math:`N`
    iterations, :math:`f(\cdot)` is the objective function,
    :math:`N \in \mathbb{N}` is the history length parameter, and each
    :math:`s^j` is a recently observed solution.

    The dynamic weight :math:`w` converges to zero as the search approaches
    its maximum runtime or iterations. It is calculated as:

    .. math::
        w = w_0 \times \min\left(1 - \frac{t}{T}, 1 - \frac{i}{I} \right)

    where :math:`w_0 \ge 0` is the initial weight parameter, :math:`T \ge 0`
    and :math:`I \ge 0` are the maximum runtime and iterations parameters,
    and :math:`t` and :math:`i` are the elapsed runtime and number of
    iterations. The dynamic weight uses whichever limit (runtime or iterations)
    is most restrictive.

    Note: The parameters ``weight`` and ``history_length`` correspond to
    :math:`\eta` and :math:`\gamma` respectively in [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weight
        Initial weight parameter :math:`w_0` used to determine the threshold
        value. Larger values result in more accepted candidate solutions. Must
        be non-negative.
    history_length
        The number of recent candidate solutions to consider when computing
        the threshold value. Must be positive.
    max_runtime
        Maximum runtime in seconds. As the search approaches this time limit,
        :math:`w \to 0`. Must be non-negative. Default is ``None``, meaning
        that :math:`w` stays equal to :math:`w_0`.
    max_iterations
        Maximum number of iterations. As the search approaches this limit,
        :math:`w \to 0`. Must be non-negative. Default is ``None``, meaning
        that :math:`w` stays equal to :math:`w_0`.
