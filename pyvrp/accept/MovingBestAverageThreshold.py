class MovingBestAverageThreshold:
    R"""
    The Moving Best Average Threshold criterion of [1]_. This criterion accepts
    a candidate solution if it is better than a threshold value. This threshold
    is based on the objective values of recently observed candidate solutions.
    Specifically, it is a convex combination of the recent best and average
    values, computed as:

    .. math::

       (1 - w) \times f(s^*) + w \times \sum_{j = 1}^N \frac{f(s^j)}{N}

    where :math:`s^*` is the best solution observed in the last :math:`N`
    iterations, :math:`f(\cdot)` is the objective function,
    :math:`N \in \mathbb{N}` is the history length parameter, and each
    :math:`s^j` is a recently observed solution.

    The weight :math:`w` is initially set at :math:`w_0 \in [0, 1]` and it
    converges to zero as the search approaches its maximum runtime or number
    of iterations. In each iteration, the weight is calculated as:

    .. math::

       w = w_0 \times \min\left(1 - \frac{t}{T}, 1 - \frac{i}{I} \right)

    where :math:`T \ge 0` and :math:`I \ge 0` are the maximum runtime and
    iterations parameters, and :math:`t` and :math:`i` are the elapsed runtime
    and number of iterations. The weight uses whichever limit (runtime or
    iterations) is most restrictive, and when either limit is exceeded,
    the weight is set to $w = 0$ instead of letting it become negative.

    .. note::
       The parameters :math:`w_0` and :math:`N` correspond to :math:`\eta`
       and :math:`\gamma` respectively in [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    initial_weight
        Initial weight parameter :math:`w_0` used to determine the threshold
        value. Larger values result in more accepted candidate solutions. Must
        be in [0, 1].
    history_length
        The number of recent candidate solutions :math:`N` to consider when
        computing the threshold value. Must be positive.
    max_runtime
        Maximum runtime in seconds. As the search approaches this time limit,
        :math:`w \to 0`. Must be non-negative. Default is ``None``, meaning
        that the runtime limit is ignored when calculating the weight.
    max_iterations
        Maximum number of iterations. As the search approaches this limit,
        :math:`w \to 0`. Must be non-negative. Default is ``None``, meaning
        that the iterations limit is ignored when calculating the weight.
