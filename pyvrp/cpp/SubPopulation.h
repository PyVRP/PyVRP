 *
 * Attributes
 * ----------
 * min_pop_size
 *     Minimum subpopulation size. This is the size of the subpopulation after
 *     survivor selection.
 * generation_size
 *     The size of a single generation, that is, the number of new solutions
 *     inserted into a subpopulation between survivor selections.
 * nb_elite
 *     Number of elite solutions. This number of fittest solutions are always
 *     survivors.
 * nb_close
 *     Number of close solutions. These are used to determine similarity
 *     between solutions, which is an important component of fitness.
 * lb_diversity
 *     A lower bound on the diversity of the solutions selected for
 *     tournament. See :meth:`~pyvrp.Population.Population.select` for details.
 * ub_diversity
 *     An upper bound on the diversity of the solutions selected for
 *     tournament. See :meth:`~pyvrp.Population.Population.select` for details.

 * survivor selection (purging) when their number grows large. A
 * subpopulation's solutions can be accessed via indexing and iteration.
 * Each solution is stored as a tuple of type ``_Item``, which stores

 * of proximity values to the other solutions in the subpopulation.
 *
 * Parameters
 * ----------
 * diversity_op
 *     Operator to use to determine pairwise diversity between solutions.
 * params
 *     Population parameters.
