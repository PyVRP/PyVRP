 *
 * Creates a duration segment.
 *
 * Duration segments can be efficiently concatenated, and track statistics
 * about route and trip duration and time warp resulting from visiting clients
 * in the concatenated order.
 *
 * Parameters
 * ----------
 * duration
 *     Total duration, including waiting time, of the current trip.
 * time_warp
 *     Total time warp on the current trip.
 * tw_early
 *     Earliest visit moment of the first client of the current trip.
 * tw_late
 *     Latest visit moment of the first client of the current trip.
 * release_time
 *     Earliest moment to start this trip segment at the depot.
 * cum_duration
 *     Cumulative duration of other trips in segment.
 * cum_time_warp
 *     Cumulative time warp of other trips in segment.
 * prev_end_late
 *     Latest end time of the previous trip, if any. Default unconstrained.
