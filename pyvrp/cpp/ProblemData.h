 * ProblemData(
 *     clients: list[Client],
 *     depots: list[Depot],
 *     vehicle_types: list[VehicleType],
 *     distance_matrices: list[numpy.ndarray[int]],
 *     duration_matrices: list[numpy.ndarray[int]],
 *     groups: list[ClientGroup] = [],
 * )
 *
 * Creates a problem data instance. This instance contains all information
 * needed to solve the vehicle routing problem.
 *
 * .. note::
 *
 *    The matrices in the ``distance_matrices`` and ``duration_matrices``
 *    arguments should have all depots in the lower indices, starting from
 *    index ``0``. See also the :meth:`~pyvrp._pyvrp.ProblemData.location`
 *    method for details.
 *
 * Parameters
 * ----------
 * clients
 *     List of clients to visit.
 * depots
 *     List of depots. At least one depot must be passed.
 * vehicle_types
 *     List of vehicle types in the problem instance.
 * distance_matrices
 *     Distance matrices that give the travel distances between all locations
 *     (both depots and clients). Each matrix corresponds to a routing profile.
 * duration_matrices
 *     Duration matrices that give the travel durations between all locations
 *     (both depots and clients). Each matrix corresponds to a routing profile.
 * groups
 *     List of client groups. Client groups have certain restrictions - see the
 *     definition for details. By default there are no groups, and empty groups
 *     must not be passed.
 *
 * Raises
 * ------
 * ValueError
 *     When the data is inconsistent.
 * IndexError
 *     When the data references clients, depots, or groups that do not exist
 *     because the referenced index is out of range.

     * ----------

     * service_duration
     *     Amount of time a vehicle needs to spend at this client before
     *     resuming its route. Service should start (but not necessarily end)
     *     within the [:py:attr:`~tw_early`, :py:attr:`~tw_late`] interval.
     *     Default 0.

     *     True. Make sure to also update the prize value when setting this
