/**
 * Solution(data: ProblemData, routes: list[Route] | list[list[int]])
 *
 * Encodes VRP solutions.
 *
 * Parameters
 * ----------
 * data
 *     Data instance.
 * routes
 *     Route list to use. Can be a list of :class:`~Route` objects, or a lists
 *     of client visits. In case of the latter, all routes are assigned
 *     vehicles of the first type. That need not be a feasible assignment!
 *
 * Raises
 * ------
 * RuntimeError
 *     When the given solution is invalid in one of several ways. In
 *     particular when the number of routes in the ``routes`` argument exceeds
 *     :py:attr:`~ProblemData.num_vehicles`, when an empty route has been
 *     passed as part of ``routes``, when too many vehicles of a particular
 *     type have been used, or when a client is visited more than once.
