@dataclass
class PenaltyParams:
    """
    The penalty manager parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repair_booster
        A repair booster value :math:`r \\ge 1`. This value is used to
        temporarily multiply the current penalty terms, to force feasibility.
        See also
        :meth:`~pyvrp.PenaltyManager.PenaltyManager.booster_cost_evaluator`.
    solutions_between_updates
        Number of feasibility registrations between penalty value updates. The
        penalty manager updates the penalty terms every once in a while based
        on recent feasibility registrations. This parameter controls how often
        such updating occurs.
    penalty_increase
        Amount :math:`p_i \\ge 1` by which the current penalties are
        increased when insufficient feasible solutions (see
        ``target_feasible``) have been found amongst the most recent
        registrations. The penalty values :math:`v` are updated as
        :math:`v \\gets p_i v`.
    penalty_decrease
        Amount :math:`p_d \\in [0, 1]` by which the current penalties are
        decreased when sufficient feasible solutions (see ``target_feasible``)
        have been found amongst the most recent registrations. The penalty
        values :math:`v` are updated as :math:`v \\gets p_d v`.
    target_feasible
        Target percentage :math:`p_f \\in [0, 1]` of feasible registrations
        in the last ``solutions_between_updates`` registrations. This
        percentage is used to update the penalty terms: when insufficient
        feasible solutions have been registered, the penalties are increased;
        similarly, when too many feasible solutions have been registered, the
        penalty terms are decreased. This ensures a balanced population, with a
        fraction :math:`p_f` feasible and a fraction :math:`1 - p_f` infeasible
        solutions.

    Attributes
    ----------
    repair_booster
        A repair booster value.
    solutions_between_updates
        Number of feasibility registrations between penalty value updates.

        increased when insufficient feasible solutions (see
        ``target_feasible``) have been found amongst the most recent

    target_feasible
        Target percentage :math:`p_f \\in [0, 1]` of feasible registrations
        in the last ``solutions_between_updates`` registrations.

class PenaltyManager:
    """
    Creates a PenaltyManager instance.

    This class manages time warp and load penalties, and provides penalty terms
    for given time warp and load values. It updates these penalties based on
    recent history, and can be used to provide a temporary penalty booster
    object that increases the penalties for a short duration.

       penalty values that are scaled according to the data instance.

    Parameters

        Initial penalty values for units of load (idx 0), duration (1), and
