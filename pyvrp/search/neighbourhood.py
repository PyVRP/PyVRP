class NeighbourhoodParams:
    """
    Configuration for calculating a granular neighbourhood.

    Attributes
    ----------
    weight_wait_time
        Penalty weight given to the minimum wait time aspect of the proximity
        calculation. A large wait time indicates the clients are far apart
        in duration/time.
    weight_time_warp
        Penalty weight given to the minimum time warp aspect of the proximity
        calculation. A large time warp indicates the clients are far apart in
        duration/time.
    nb_granular
        Number of other clients that are in each client's granular
        neighbourhood. This parameter determines the size of the overall
        neighbourhood.
    symmetric_proximity
        Whether to calculate a symmetric proximity matrix. This ensures edge
        :math:`(i, j)` is given the same weight as :math:`(j, i)`.
    symmetric_neighbours
        Whether to symmetrise the neighbourhood structure. This ensures that
        when edge :math:`(i, j)` is in, then so is :math:`(j, i)`. Note that
        this is *not* the same as ``symmetric_proximity``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When ``nb_granular`` is non-positive.
