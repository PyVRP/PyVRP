    "# Classic VRPs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use PyVRP to solve two classic variants of the VRP: the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), and the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW).\n",
    "It builds on the tutorial by solving much larger instances, and going into more detail about the various plotting tools and diagnostics available in PyVRP.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CVRP instance is defined on a complete graph $G=(V,A)$, where $V$ is the vertex set and $A$ is the arc set. \n",
    "The vertex set $V$ is partitioned into $V=\\{0\\} \\cup V_c$, where $0$ represents the depot and $V_c=\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ denotes the set of $n$ customers.\n",
    "Each arc $(i, j) \\in A$ has a weight $d_{ij} \\ge 0$ that represents the travel distance from $i \\in V$ to $j \\in V$.\n",
    "Each customer $i \\in V_c$ has a demand $q_{i} \\ge 0$.\n",
    "The objective is to find a feasible solution that minimises the total distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A VRPTW instance additionally incorporates time aspects into the problem.\n",
    "For the sake of exposition we assume the travel duration $t_{ij} \\ge 0$ is equal to the travel distance $d_{ij}$ in this notebook.\n",
    "Each customer $i \\in V_c$ has a service time $s_{i} \\ge 0$ and a (hard) time window $\\left[e_i, l_i\\right]$ that denotes the earliest and latest time that service can start.\n",
    "A vehicle is allowed to arrive at a customer location before the beginning of the time window, but it must wait for the window to open to start the delivery. \n",
    "Each vehicle must return to the depot before the end of the depot time window $H$.\n",
    "The objective is to find a feasible solution that minimises the total distance.\n",
    "\n",
