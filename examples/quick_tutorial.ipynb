    "- We first solve a capacitated VRP, introducing the modelling interface and the most basic components.\n",
    "- We then solve a VRP with time windows, where we introduce the support PyVRP has for problems with duration constraints.\n",
    "- We then solve a multi-depot VRP with time windows and maximum route duration constraints.\n",
    "- We also solve a prize-collecting VRP with optional clients to showcase the modelling optional client visits.\n",
    "- We then solve a VRP with simultaneous pickup and delivery to show problems with deliveries from the depot to clients, and return shipments from clients to depots.\n",
    "- We also show how to model VRPs where exactly one client must be selected from a set of alternatives.\n",
    "- We briefly show how to use routing profiles to model zone restrictions.\n",
    "- Finally, we show how to model a VRP with reloading at various reload depots along the route."
